HTML Startup Project: Things I learned

Throughout the process I've gained proficiency with a lot of commands within the git framework.
git pull, add . , git commit -m "", git push.

I've dabbled with merging. It appears that I'm still having troubles with that but I'm sure that I'll figure it out eventually.

I learned a bit about how to use file transfer protocol to launch the website. Additionally, I learned how to
organize my code in a way that is appealing and readable.

I learned more about security considerations, the history of web domains and why they matter, and why it's
important to have an ssh.

Additionally I learned that while html and css are not programming languages, they are probably the most fun
and engaging to work with. I love seeing the styles, and I think that it's a really important part of the
user experience.

STARTUP CSS NOTES

I think I learned more in the last 24 hours than I ever have in my entire life. It wasn't just about programming, I had a long talk with my friend and we decided that we were going to go all in on a construction company while we are in college.

I learned a lot about space allocation, and how css can save you having to change individual elements in the html over and over again.

I learned more about creating a server to store user data, and just how time intensive it can become.

I learned that creating something that you are passionate about really has some insane effects on how much work you are willing to get done.
