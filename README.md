# Pillar Constructs Co. Website

## Introduction
This application is centered solely around a construction business that I will be starting with my friend. The idea is to give customers some tangible way to reach out to us and see what we're all about.

Here is a rough outline of what the app format would look like: ![Project Plan](WebProgrammingStartup.jpg)

## STARTUP CSS IMPLEMENTATIONS
- I completely redid the project for part. I found that I wasn't too engaged in the idea of CommunityTogether (My last Project) so I decided to revamp it and create something that I will actually use.

## Key Features
- Service and Project Showcases: Detailed and visually appealing presentations of our services and past projects.
- Real-Time Contact Form: A straightforward and user-friendly form on the "Contact Us" page, ensuring you can reach out to us anytime.
- Responsive Design: A website design that looks great on any device, enhancing your browsing experience whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

## Technology Implementation

- This tab is the home page for the Pillar Constructs Co. website. It contains information regarding what we do and user reviews, and links to all of the different pages.

## About Tab
- This tab just gives some basic information on Me and Aaron (My business partner). We want customers to put a name to the company, and we want to appear human, as they say.

## Contact Tab
- This tab gives you the ability to contact us. There is currently some placeholder information and some text boxes that will allow connectivity in the future.
