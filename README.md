Real Time Community Event Planner

This application allows users to discover and participate in local community events in real-time. It targets individuals looking to engage more with their local community, participate in events, or organize their own. The app provides a platform for real-time interaction, event updates, and community engagement. Is a neighbor having a barbecue? Is the whole town getting together for a volleyball game? This would be the place to find out.

Key Features:
Event Creation and Browsing: Users can create events, browse upcoming events, and join them. Events could range from local workshops, sports activities, neighborhood meetings, to impromptu gatherings.

Real-Time Chat and Updates: Using WebSockets, the app provides real-time communication channels for each event, allowing attendees and organizers to communicate instantly, share updates, and modify event details in real-time.

Interactive Maps: Display events on an interactive map, allowing users to explore events in their vicinity. Hopefully we could implement google maps and apple maps as well.

User Profiles and Authentication: Secure user authentication for account creation, with user profiles showcasing their interests and past event participation.

Feedback and Ratings: After events, attendees can leave feedback and rate their experience, helping to build a trusted community. You can rate the safety of the event as well, whether or not it is adult oriented, or if it is E for Everyone.

Notifications and Alerts: Real-time notifications about event changes, reminders, and updates from events the user is interested in. You will be able to change what notifications you receive, whether it is just for events that you signed up for, or every time a certain person schedules an event.

Technology Implementation:
HTML: Structure the application with separate HTML pages for event browsing, event details, user profiles, and chat windows.
CSS: Use CSS for styling, ensuring responsiveness for various devices, and creating an easy-to-navigate interface.
JavaScript: Implement interactive features like event registration, live chat, dynamic map updates, and client-side validations.
